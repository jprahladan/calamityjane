Hi! You've now entered into jprahladan's domain. There's a lot I would like to share with you, but then again, sometimes, things are best left unsaid. The personal can be deciphered and interpreted from the professional, but not always. We humans tend to compartmentalize our lives so, that we can experience the diversity that life provides us, within each new context. 

# Attempt at a Main Title

This is a good way to express titles and subtitles for the reports that you shall be writing. The ri
## This calls for a new subtitle starting from now
And yes, the text within this bodydoes not have a different style. The content continues to have a format that's similar to before. 

### Below this point, you get the sub-sub-heading!
Some points to remember as you adopt this format:
- A bulleted list
- A list with bullets
It takes a while to work from here
1. Numbered
2. List

A good way to cite pages is by using [this text needs to be cited][prash_cite]
**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.

Tables: 
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

I think you should use an `<addr> </addr>` element here instead.

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
